Come here little boy
I'm a friend of your mother's
I'll give you a candy bar if you get in the car
Okay

He's got his camera
And deep seeded obsessions
His nordic heritage
And sexual frustrations

He wants to be Lief Ericksson
To discover America
But he's not
He's just a photographer
Who likes little boys in viking suits

He likes to take the little boys
Walking home from school
In his neighborhood
Take them to his studio
And dress them up in viking suits

Words of wisdom
Each one rings true
Watching little brothers could happen to you
So don't grow up to be a guy
Who takes pictures of little boys in viking suits

Come here little boy
